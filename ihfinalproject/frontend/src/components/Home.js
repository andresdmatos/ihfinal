        FAMER'S STORY Great coaching is all about personal attention. The more
        personal the coach gets, the better the student becomes. But personal
        coaching is expensive and coaches canâ€™t give their full personal
        attention to many trainees at the same time. Famer is an affordable
        personalized communication coaching platform designed to support coaches
        in sharing their knowledge and expertise at scale, yet on a personal
        level. Regularly using Famer encourages training beyond official class
        time and allows coaches to empower trainees with a constant presence of
        a mentor in their lives.
