          FAMER'S STORY Great coaching is all about personal attention. The more
          personal the coach gets, the better the student becomes. But personal
          coaching is expensive and coaches canâ€™t give their full personal
          attention to many trainees at the same time. Famer is an affordable
          personalized communication coaching platform designed to support
          coaches in sharing their knowledge and expertise at scale, yet on a
          personal level. Regularly using Famer encourages training beyond
          official class time and allows coaches to empower trainees with a
          constant presence of a mentor in their lives.
